# Vessyl Static Site

As we begin the marketing work for our game, we will use a static site to communicate with our audience important information about our game, who our team is and the updates from our project as we make progress throughout our Capstone.

## Sections
Our site has three main sections. 

### Main / Home

The main landing page which acts as the hub for users to get quick access to new builds, a quick rundown of what the game is and navigate to the other sections of our site. This will likely be edited sporadically to update links to builds, trailers and so on.

### Team

The team site will contain information about the internal, external and committee team members. It will also be the place for us to share all relevant links we might want to (e.g. our LinkedIn, portfolios, etc). This site will likely be edited the least.

### Project Report

The project report is where we'll share the most content and will likely be the section we edit the most. Content for the project report will follow a pretty consistent format, to make sure returning users know what to expect in every update.
